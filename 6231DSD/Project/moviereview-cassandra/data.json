    "review_detail": "After seeing Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol: 1, I got to watch Vol. 2 the next day after seeing it. I liked the first one but didn't really know everything that was going on, but just knowing that she set off the kill 5 individuals who left her dead at her wedding. So I saw Kill Bill: Vol 2 and liked it highly. The movie answered all of my questions to the previous one and had much of a better story and was not unrealistic that much. We finally get to see Bill, who is played by David Carradine who had a really good role in the movie. There is a great conclusion to the movie and had a very good story, along with likable characters, my favorite being Budd. Overall, good movie that answers tons of questions. I recommend Kill Bill Vol. 2.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B",

    "review_detail": "I have the entire series on video, taped mostly from Sky (Europe) broadcasts. After 35+ years, the show still holds up well. Each show featured an American actor in the lead with British supporting players. Some of my favorite actors in the series included George Maharis, formerly of Route 66, and Barbara Jefford, a British actress. Ms. Jefford played an evil aunt to a boy made to wear dresses and pose as a girl. It would be great if the series would be released on DVD but I'm afraid it's one of the countless short-run series that are very fondly remembered but will never make it to disc. This would be a great series for Encore Mysteries to run.",

    "review_detail": "Once again the critics prove themselves as morons! This movie was definitely the best I've seen this summer and deserves a lot more recognition than it is getting. People see the name Michael Bay and instantly think of a sappy action movie not worth the time, but trust me, this one is definitely worth your time and money.I won't comment on specifics of the story because I don't want to spoil it, but as a whole it is very impressive, and tackles many issues that we face in today's society.The acting is great, and Ewan McGregor pulled off his character perfectly. The innocence and wonder that he expresses as Lincoln 6 Echo was the best I've seen from him.I'll admit that the first half of the movie is better than the 2nd half, and the many chase scenes can get frustrating, but the action adds a lot to the movie, and the directing is wonderful.But the one point that this movie tackled which makes it noteworthy is the characterization. I really cared for the two lead characters and wanted to see them succeed in their goal, which is rare in most action films. I even enjoyed seeing the minor characters through the movie, so much that I cared about their outcomes. Not to mention that they are believable. The main character in this film isn't some invulnerable super action hero, he is frail and inexperienced when it comes to fighting. There weren't any moments that I thought he was going out of his capabilities. The characters are confused and weak, and they are depicted wonderfully.Come on people, stop obsessing over the frat comedies, crappy comic-book adaptations, and dumb horror movies, and treat yourself to a good film. Don't pass this one up. GO AND SEE IT NOW!",

Won't give it away but you will more than likely be able to figure it out ten minutes into the movie. The only positive thing about the flick are the actors and actressess giving their characters persona and the character Tad Hamilton, since he's actually not JUST a slimeball one-dimensional character but actually a guy who does transform during the coarse of the movie, just like the other two leads.. Kinda cute but by the looks of it it didn't make it all that well at the box office. Looks cheap. 3/10",

    "review_detail": "Here's the truth. There's not much to this movie at all. I was sucked in by the high rating and overly positive reviews that must have submitted by cast and film crew. I won't give a technical analysis like an ameteur movie critic, just my sincere opinion.The Droving was annoying from the jump due to not being able to hear the opening dialogue over the ambient sounds. At times it was so difficult to hear what was being said, I had to turn on the caption. I knew after that The Droving was starting with a negative balance and really good things had to happen moving forward to win me over.Film is beautiful with many nature scenes. It does not appear to be low budget from that standpoint. It also has a decent pace, so I didn't fall asleep (I was close on occasions). With those things being stated, cinematographer and pace could not save this film and rightfully so!Where the Droving falls apart, is with the story, in my humble opinion. The premise is interesting but the story is not well developed. The main character is almost as much as a mystery as the movie's story itself. The climax is very anticlimactic and evolves rapidly to an abrupt ending that left me scratching my head.Finally, there are worse movies out there than The Droving. It had potential to be a good watch, but missed the mark majorly with story and character development. Background sound made it difficult at times to hear dialogue and ending was a total letdown; making it a film that can be bypassed for most other movie options.",

Excellent writing, directing and performances all around, particularly by Bette Davis and Anne Baxter in their respective immortal roles, as well as unpredictable and filled with complex characters and relationships, All About Eve is one of the best movies I have ever seen.As I got about halfway through the movie, I thought it was about how jealousy and resentment can drive the people away from you. But it's not. It's a movie about manipulation and how horrible people can con people into getting what they want. It's such a great film.",

    "review_detail": "I see that Netflix has a teenage/kids audience and this is why they are making yet another typical rom-com. This movie was suppose to stand out from the rest of the Netflix standards.Unfortunately..The writing was horrible. Love is messy but that doesn't mean the writing should be messy too! It seemed like the writer wanted to make a messy love story but forgot to actually focus on the STORY and rather just used quotes that left us with nothing. The characters had no depth and I felt like the writer was trying too hard to make them sound philosophical rather than just being a normal teenager trying to actually find love and not be in a 70 years old mind.\nNeeded another 1h and 40min to cover up all the many and messy parts of the movie.What triggeres me the most is that through out the whole movie the main core is \"WHAT IS LOVE\" where the movie follows how love is messy but actully never focuses on the long journey of it. All of a sudden the movie is rushed to an ending where all of the 3 protagonists finds the \"key\" to love and then knows everything about love after a KISS and some cliche quotes. COMEON. SHOW US THE LIVELIHOOD OF LOVE. Not the vague idea written in books with random quotes about the universe and stars.Of course the soundtrack has to be good just to occopy the teenagers mind to think that the movie is so great even though it's not. 4 stars for acting, soundtrack, editing etc..",

Blood runs freely as Moira makes it look as if the bullies are committing suicide. She is terrifying to behold, her limbs slashed from self-harming, wearing a necklace of razor blades. A disturbing film which will stick in your mind long after the final credits roll. Good performances by Rubenstein and McCormick. IMDB has it at 4.5/10 but I think Director Adam Egypt Mortimer's bloody horror flick deserves 7/10. On the Horror Channel.",

    "review_detail": "Well, I just finished watching Gaspar Noe's CARNE (1991), and now I have seen all of his movies. Not as many people know about Carne because it's a 35 minute short film, not a feature length film - BUT, his debut feature film I STAND ALONE is actually a direct continuation of what occurs in CARNE. Though I have known about I STAND ALONE since about 2003, I didn't hear about CARNE until this year. I actually think CARNE is superior to I STAND ALONE - because of the short runtime it's paced very quickly and features more of Gaspar's stylish cutting and editing. It is thoroughly entertaining, while I STAND ALONE is more a slow-burning, icky-feeling build to a wretched climax that will make pretty much everyone feel like they need to take a shower afterwards.Any way, this movie is very good. Probably one of the best short films I have ever seen. The singular style is turned up to 10. The performances are on point. And the dialogue, subject matter, and some of the visuals are immensely jarring. Though I STAND ALONE is not a movie I would ever recommend to anyone (because of the sickening subject matter), I suggest that for those who are interested, do not watch I STAND ALONE without seeing CARNE first. They should be watched in sequence, just as one should watch something like KILL BILL Vol. 1 and 2.Now that I've seen all of Gaspar Noe's films... I would rank them in this order...ENTER THE VOID > IRREVERSIBLE > CLIMAX > CARNE > LOVE > I STAND ALONE",

Worthy credit must be humongously mentioned as well to Dan Goor & Michael Schur for writing such a masterpiece of a show that is TV GoldHaving arrived late to this show (started watching when Season 6 came out) I knew that I had the opportunity to binge watch seasons upon seasons if I liked it and it only took 3 episodes for me to know it was the show for me. Having not been a big fan of the pilot the second episode of Season 1 was better and by the third I wanted to watch more and more with one of the best parts being when you rewatch old episodes it feels like your watching them for the first time again.The characters all fit together in their own way without anyone overplaying their part, they're also hilariously funny & practically all of them are extremely likeable none more so IMO than Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti) also additionally I could possibly say that Amy Santiago & Jake Peralta are quite argubaly the best couple to come out of a TV show potentially ever. Furthermore, I also love Terry's fascination of Yoghurt & speaking in the third person, Rosa's character development throughout the show & Captain's Holt unique take on life.All in all, this is my favourite show and I hope it is commissioned for more series once I have finished the current one",

Ricky is a phenomenal comedian and brilliant actor. His portrayal of a grief stricken husband will break your heart. You can genuinely feel his pain despite the odd glimmer of the happy man he used to be. Of course, I have to mention the dog - oh my God!!! I love the dog!!!! Watch this show please but prepare for tears!!!! Keep up the great work Ricky!!!! You're a legend.",

    "review_detail": "Woo this family. They make my family look normal and that's scary. The first few episodes were tedious. We're told how horrible Danny is without much reason why. They finally start showing his true colors in a way that felt organic. So many lies and unspoken Truths. So many family secrets. And my interest was held for several episodes until the very end. By the end I couldn't figure out why these people want to be in each others lives. They are all miserable. Their relationships are so toxic.\nIt's a good show worthy of watching but it's so hard to get behind any of the characters. I just want one of them to make a good choice. They just keep chasing bad choice after bad choice.",

Liu Xing, the eldest son of the three children, is really mischievous, but also gives the audience a lot of joy. I like xiadonghai. He can educate children rationally most of the time. Now that I'm older, I feel very relaxed when I watch this play. It's a good play to relieve pressure.",
